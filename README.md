# test_and_learning

## Description
This repo simply contains a mashup of various experiments I have run for learning purposes. Examples include test labs from various pdfs and hand coded examples of many popular ML / Stats functions. I decided to create this repo in order to keep track of my progress in terms of implementing various algos by scratch. I also use this repo to test various methods that I may be unfamiliar with in an environment where there is very little reprucussion.
